1. Quick start
**************
Complete a few steps to set up your Power Profiler Kit (PPK). In the simplest configuration, the PPK is connected to an nRF5 Development Kit (DK, not included in the package).

In this quick start, the PPK measures current on the nRF5 DK device, which also acts as a power supply and sends data to the Power Profiler application.

1. Prepare the nRF5 DK for current measurements by cutting the nRF current measurement solder bridge. 
#. Connect the PPK to the nRF5 DK as shown in the following figure.    
#. Connect the USB cable to the nRF5 DK and a computer. 
#. Set the switches on the PPK as shown in the figure above. 
#. Install the PPK software. 
#. Start the Power Profiler application. 

The PPK is ready to use.
